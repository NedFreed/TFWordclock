This fork has has GPS and DST support added to the Arduino version. The details are given in the source code,
but the basic approach is to attach a GPS receiver to digital I/O pins D4 and D5 and use the TinyGPS and
SoftwareSerial libraries to read time data and periodically adjust the built in RTC.

DST support consists of a table of days on which DST transitions occur, code to check that table against the
data coming from the GPS, and update times accordingly. The table was generated by a modified version of the
zdump utilities, which is also provided. Users in non-US areas can use the modified zdump to generate their
own versions of the table.
